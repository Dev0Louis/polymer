# Polymer
It's a library for creating server side content, that work for player's without mods or (required) resource packs!
You can create blocks, items and entities, that not only will work fully on server side (and singleplayer), but also
are represented on server the same as normal (vanilla/modded) ones (unlike bukkit/spigot ones, that are stored as vanilla block).

This library also should work correctly with other, non-polymer mods and PolyMC!

For information about usage you can check official docs at https://polymer.pb4.eu/!

### If you are a server owner, you most likely wanted to get [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc)

Some code in this library is based on [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc). So if you are using Polymer, give a star to PolyMC too!
