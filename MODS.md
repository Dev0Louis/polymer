# Mods using Polymer
Some mods/ports using Polymer, ordered alphabetically

## Brewery
Brewery is a Fabric/Quilt compatible mod allowing you to create alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks 
with cauldrons and barrels. Aside of few builtin ones, you can add any number of custom drinks with 
their own recipes and functionality by using datapacks. Additionally, this mod can work purely server side, 
allowing vanilla clients to join and use its capabilities.

## ComputerCraft: Restitched with Polymer
This is a port of CC: Restitched (which by itself is port of CC: Tweaked, continuation of original ComputerCraft), 
modified in a way to allow nearly all functionality of regular version to work purely server side 
(Vanilla client can join servers using it and have all functionality!). 
It still requires server to run on Fabric or Quilt, so keep that in mind!
